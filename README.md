# Circular Progress Bar

<p>This project implements a dynamic circular progress bar using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It visually represents a percentage-based progress indicator with a smooth animation, designed to enhance user interface elements that require progress tracking.</p>
<h2>Key Features</h2>
<h3>Animated Circular Progress Bar</h3>
<p>The progress bar is a circular SVG element that animates from 0% to a defined percentage, providing a visual representation of progress. The animation is smooth and responsive, gradually revealing the progress in a clockwise direction.</p>
<h3>Percentage Display</h3>
<p>A numerical percentage is displayed at the center of the circular progress bar, updating in real-time as the animation progresses. This provides a clear and concise indicator of the current progress value.</p>
<h2>Technical Overview</h2>
<h3>HTML Structure</h3>
<p>The HTML file structures the progress bar within a container div, including an SVG element that defines the circular path. A separate div is used to display the percentage number in the center of the circle.</p>
<h3>CSS Styling</h3>
<h4>Design and Layout</h4>
<p>The progress bar is styled to be centered on the page, with a modern design featuring soft shadows and a gradient stroke. The outer and inner circles are styled with box shadows to create a 3D effect, enhancing the visual appeal.</p>
<h4>SVG and Circle Styling</h4>
<p>The circular path of the progress bar is styled using a gradient color, which transitions from pink to purple. The stroke of the circle is animated using the `stroke-dasharray` and `stroke-dashoffset` properties to create the progress effect.</p>
<h3>JavaScript Functionality</h3>
<h4>Progress Animation</h4>
<p>The JavaScript file includes a script that increments a counter from 0 to 65, updating both the percentage displayed in the center of the circle and the progress animation. The `setInterval` function is used to increment the counter every 30 milliseconds until the desired percentage is reached, at which point the interval is cleared.</p>

    setInterval(() => {
        // Function implementation
    }, 30);

<h2>In Summary</h2>
<p>This circular progress bar project offers an engaging way to represent progress within a user interface. The combination of smooth animations, gradient styling, and real-time percentage updates makes it a visually appealing and functional component for web applications.</p>
